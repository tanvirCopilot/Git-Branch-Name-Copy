# Welcome to your VS Code Extension's Quick Start Guide

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all the files for your extension.
* `src/extension.ts` is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your extension.
* `package.json` contains the extension manifest and configuration.
* `README.md` contains documentation for your extension.
* `CHANGELOG.md` contains the version history of your extension.
* `LICENSE` contains the license for your extension.
* `.vscodeignore` contains files that should be excluded when packaging the extension.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) by typing `"Copy Git Branch Name"`.
* Find errors in your extension's output channel by running `"Developer: Show Logs"` then selecting `"Extension Host"`.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* Check out the [Visual Studio Code extension API documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) to learn more about the extension API.
* Visit the [extension samples repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) to see more examples of extension development.

## Run tests

* Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `"Extension Tests"`.
* Press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded.
* See the output of your test run in the debug console.
* Make changes to `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside `src/test/suite`.
* The test runner will discover all files ending in `.test.ts` inside the `src/test/suite` folder.
* See [Testing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension) for more information.

## Go further

* Reduce the extension size and improve startup time by [bundling your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension).
* Publish your extension on the VS Code [extension marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension).
* Automate builds with [GitHub Actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration).
